# Smart-Contract-Vulnerability-Detection-Model

This project addresses the pressing issue of smart contract vulnerabilities in blockchain technology. Employing a Gated Multi-layer Perceptron (gMLP) model enhanced with Multi-label Classification, our project offers a time-efficient and precise solution for vulnerability detection.

**Introduction**

With the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, smart contracts have emerged as a transformative technology since their debut on the Ethereum platform in 2015. However, the complexity of programming languages like Solidity and the immutable nature of blockchain have made smart contracts prone to errors and exploitation. Notable incidents like the DAO hack and Parity Wallet mishaps, resulting in significant financial losses, underscore the need for improved security measures.

Traditional tools like Slither and Oyente offer some protection against smart contract vulnerabilities but have inherent limitations in their effectiveness and scope. As a result, research has pivoted towards leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for improved vulnerability detection. So far, only a handful of studies have focused on multi-label classification. Although these have shown promising results using attention mechanisms, these methods require considerable computational resources. Addressing this gap, our project employs a more efficient Gated Multi-layer Perceptron (gMLP) model integrated with Multi-label Classification to effectively and efficiently detect multiple vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

**Methodology**

1. Data Acquisition: A robust dataset of 79,641 smart contracts for training and validation, along with 15,972 for testing, was collected from ‘Slither Audited Smart Contracts Dataset’.
2. Labelling System: Smart contracts were systematically organized into six-dimensional columns, enabling the construction of a multi-label classification.
3. Converting into Opcode and Simplification: Bytecode was converted into more accessible opcodes and simplified to avoid the "dimension disaster" and to ensure efficient analysis.
4. Feature Extraction: Using the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TFIDF) methodology, pertinent features were extracted from the simplified opcode after dividing the data into training and validation sets. This emphasized the relevant aspects, enhancing vulnerability detection.
5. Training and Classification: Inspired by the approach outlined in "Pay Attention to MLPs," we have integrated a gating mechanism into the MLP model. To further address the challenges of multi-label classification in the context of smart contract vulnerability detection, we employed the binary relevance (BR) strategy.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

This research project set out to address the vital need for enhanced security in smart contracts, focusing on the utilization of a modified Gated Multi-layer Perceptron (gMLP) model for vulnerability detection. The model's performance, evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, underscores its robustness and efficacy in identifying vulnerabilities with heightened accuracy. This not only serves as a proof-of-concept but also establishes a benchmark for future models targeting the seamless integration of speed and accuracy in vulnerability detection within smart contracts. In addition, we have three suggestions for this task:

1.	Exploration of Label Dependencies: Our model employed a Binary Relevance strategy to construct six separate branches for individual binary classifications, assuming label independence. As vulnerabilities may not always be independent, it would be prudent for future studies to investigate the potential dependencies among different types of vulnerabilities.

2.	User Interface Development: With the foundational work laid out, there exists an opportunity to develop a user-friendly interface that visualizes vulnerabilities, making the model's insights more accessible to developers and cybersecurity experts.

3.	Detection of Emerging Vulnerabilities: Our current model focuses on known vulnerabilities, but the landscape is continually evolving. Future work could extend the model's capabilities to identify emerging vulnerabilities by training it on more recent and diverse datasets.

In summary, while our gMLP model for smart contract vulnerability detection marks a significant step forward, there remain exciting avenues for further research and development to foster an even more secure blockchain ecosystem.
